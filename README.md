## Contribution guidelines

Go to the following page to view general development guidelines for the project: https://github.com/Create-Third-Places

Also, follow the guidelines below:
- Keep PRs as small as possible. Large features should be broken down into multiple PRs when possible.
- If a PR has UI changes, it is helpful to include a screenshot of the change in the PR.
- Code that is associated with a specific part of the UI should be in the src/events/scripts folder.
- JavaScript logic is not associated with a specific part of the UI should be placed in the src/framework folder.
- UI elements that are dynamic or will be used multiple times should be implemented as [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
- For new files, TypeScript should be used.


## Development

### How to run locally with mocks
Note: This enables the UI to run locally without the API by using mocks. The mocks consist of hardcoded data that will simulate API responses which may not be reflect the actual UI state.
They should only be used when attempting to test UI changes that do not depend on API results.

### Setup
- npm install
- npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
  
### Running in dev mode
- npm run dev
  
### Creating a preview
- npm run build
- npm run preview

### How to run locally with API and database.
- Follow the same setup steps as the previous seciton
- See the following instructions for runing the API and database: https://github.com/Create-Third-Places/development


## Future changes

### GroupSearchResult pages
 - Each group has a page at https://dmvboardgames.com/group/{group name} with group and event information.
 - Each group has a page at https://dmvboardgames.com/group/{group name}/edit for editing group information that will be accessible by admins
 - Each event has a page at https://dmvboardgames.com/group/{group name}/event/{event name} with event information.
 - Each group has a page at https://dmvboardgames.com/group/{group name}/event/{event name}/edit for editing event information that will be accessible by admins

### Authentication

- Support for users logging in once and make multiple edits when they have admin permissions.


### Creating groups and events

- Add support for users being able to create groups and events. Users besides site admins should be limited to creating two groups.
- New groups and events will need to be approved by an admin at first before they show up on the homepage of dmvboardgames.com. This will probably be temporary until the site is in a more complete state.
- Events should be filtered by the search criteria on the UI. By default, only events for the next week will be shown.
  
- Add support for new account creation without manual action by a site admin.   


## Testing

- To test with the production API, set the DEPLOY_ENV variable to prod
